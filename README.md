# PersonalPage

Hello, my name is Aima, I’m 21, and in my second semester at UOC. I work as a customer service agent for the Jack Wolfskin project at Concentrix, where I've been for over a year. My interest in programming began in high school, where I studied accounting and computer software. Balancing work and studies can be challenging, but I’m committed to pursuing both successfully.
